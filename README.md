Predication of Employee Turnover using Ensemble Learning Algorithms

“You take away our top ten employees and we the Microsoft will become one of the mediocre companies”, this statement by Bill Gates is enough to prove the importance of the employee turnover.

Employee turnover is now becoming a major problem in IT organizations, telecommunications and many other industries. 
Why employees leave the organization? is the question raising among many HR managers. Employees are the most important 
assets of an organization. Hiring new employees will always take more efforts and cost rather than retaining the old ones. 
This project focuses on finding the key features of voluntary employee turnover and how they can be overcome well before time. 
The problem is to classify whether an employee will leave or stay. Data is taken from IBM Watson analytics. 
Machine Learning algorithms are often showcased for classification problems. 
The proposed work will use the application of ensemble learning to solve the problem, rather than focusing on a 
single classifier algorithm. Each classification model will be assigned with some weight based on the individual 
predicted accuracy. The ensemble model will calculate the weightage average for the probabilities of the individual 
classification and based on this weightage average, an employee can be classified. 
Accurate prediction will help organizations take necessary steps towards controlling retention.
